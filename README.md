A prototype zero dependency Go Client for [Microsoft's Graph API](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/overview).

## Disclaimers

**This library is not under active development.** It (probably) works as it stands, but is very incomplete and I don't have the intention of building it out further at this time. Think of it as an academic exercise; maybe learn from it, or fork it if you'd like.

This project is completely unaffiliated with Microsoft.
